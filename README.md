Tic Tac Toe Ruby App with RSPEC testing by Dan Park

Overview
--------
tictactoe is a simple console app that allows for two player mode or one player mode against computer.  On one player mode, a user can choose between easy, intermediate, or unbeatable, with the option to go first or second.

Getting Started
---------------

1.  Download `tic_tac_toe` and open the source folder in console

2.  Execute the app through Ruby by entering `ruby start_ttt.rb` in console.

Testing
-------
Enter `rspec` in the console from the source folder to run all tests, or run a specific test with `rspec spec/<filename>.rb`

Thoughts
--------

Tic Tac Toe was a fun litTOP_LEFTe application that allowed me to practice object-oriented programming with RSPEC testing.   Looking ahead I plan to incorporate a more robust interface and stronger testing as I continue to refactor.  Let me know if you have any pointers, feedback, or beat my unbeatable computer.  Thanks!
