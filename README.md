TicTacToe
===========

Tic Tac Toe Ruby App with rspec testing by Dan Park

Overview
--------
ticTacToe is a simple console app that allows for two player mode or one player mode against computer.  On one player mode, a user can choose between easy, intermediate, or unbeatable.

Getting Started
---------------

1.  Download `ticTacToe` and open the source folder in console

2.  Execute the app through Ruby by entering `ruby run_app.rb` in console.

Testing
-------
Enter `rspec` in the console from the source folder to run all tests, or run a specific test with `rspec spec/<filename>.rb`

Thoughts
--------

Tic Tac Toe was a fun little application that allowed me to practice object-oriented programming and some much needed practic with RSPEC.  I chose to write most of my code and methods in modules, so that I wouldn't need to create new class instances, and  methods could easily inherit instance variables.  Looking ahead I plan to incorporate a more robust interface and more comprehensive testing as I continue to refactor.
